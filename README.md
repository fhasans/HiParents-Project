# HiParents-Project
Hi-Parent is an application that helps parents who leave their children in daycare so that they can monitor whattheir children are doing with their caregivers. The main feature Hi-Parents make is to help parents. They can monitor children in daycare so they can feel relief when entrusting children to daycare. For nannies, they can update child activities every 1 hour.
